## 📦 What is this?

This repository contains a custom driver written from scratch for the **DM8BA10 LCD** display module, powered by a mysterious **TM1622** controller.  
It’s one of those "*cool looking things you randomly buy from AliExpress*" and then realize... **there’s no documentation for it.** 🤷

## 💡 Features

- 🧠 Pure GPIO bit-banging (SPI-like protocol)
- 🧾 Fully reverse-engineered protocol implementation
- 🔢 Digit-wise segment addressing (10 digits supported)
- 🔤 Built-in font table for ASCII characters (and a custom ° symbol!)
- 📜 String printing with alignment (`left`, `center`, `right`)
- ➡️⬅️ Scrolling text (RTL & LTR)
- ⏱️ Timer-based interrupt scrolling (commented section)
- 🧼 Clear all / All-on segment control

## ⚙️ Requirements

- STM32 microcontroller (tested with STM32F103, but I am pretty sure this will work on different nucleos since this driver uses standard HAL library)
- HAL library (CubeMX)
- A patient and slightly masochistic attitude
